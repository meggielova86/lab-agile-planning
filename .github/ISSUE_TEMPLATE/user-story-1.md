As a Scrum philosophy student 
 I need to read the Scrum guide
 So that I gain a good knowledge and can get a certificate 
   
 ### Details and Assumptions
 Scrum Guide can be found on scrum.org
There are free assesment tests available 
   
Given that I have all the information 
When I have read all of it
Then I should be able to complete the assesment tests.
